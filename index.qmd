## About Me

Hi there! I'm Swadhin, an economist with a deep curiosity for understanding how data can drive better decisions. With my PhD and over 15 years of experience, I've had the privilege of working across academia, research institutions, and policy organizations.

Currently, I serve as **Associate Professor and Head of Department** at the University of Nizwa in Oman, where I lead our Economics and Finance department and mentor the next generation of economists. I also work as an Economic Advisor with Infinite Sum Modelling, applying advanced quantitative methods to tackle complex problems.

### What drives me:
- **Research**: I love diving deep into econometric modeling and causal inference
- **Policy Impact**: Translating complex analysis into actionable insights for governments and organizations  
- **Teaching**: Sharing knowledge and inspiring students to see the beauty in economic theory
- **Innovation**: Exploring how modern analytical techniques can solve age-old economic questions

I'm authorized to work in the UK and always excited to collaborate on meaningful projects that make a difference.
